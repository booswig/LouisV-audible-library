window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Robert Bathurst's intelligent narration captures every nuance, every emotion, and each of Louise Penny's subtle revelations about the unique, completely engaging residents of Three Pines.\" — </b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine, </i></b><b>Earphones Award winner</b></p> <p><i>Catastrophic spring flooding, blistering attacks in the media, and a mysterious disappearance greet Chief Inspector Armand Gamache as he returns to the Sûreté du Québec in the latest novel by #1 </i>New York Times <i>bestselling author Louise Penny.</i> <br> <br> It’s Gamache’s first day back as head of the homicide department, a job he temporarily shares with his previous second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir. Flood waters are rising across the province. In the middle of the turmoil a father approaches Gamache, pleading for help in finding his daughter. <br> <br> As crisis piles upon crisis, Gamache tries to hold off the encroaching chaos, and realizes the search for Vivienne Godin should be abandoned. But with a daughter of his own, he finds himself developing a profound, and perhaps unwise, empathy for her distraught father. <br> <br> Increasingly hounded by the question, <i>how would you feel</i>…, he resumes the search. <br> <br> As the rivers rise, and the social media onslaught against Gamache becomes crueler, a body is discovered. And in the tumult, mistakes are made. <br> <br> In the next title in this “constantly surprising series that deepens and darkens as it evolves” (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>), Gamache must face a horrific possibility, and a burning question. </p> <p><i>What would you do if your child’s killer walked free?</i></p> <p><b>Praise for</b><b><i> A Better Man:</i></b></p> <p>“‘A Better Man,' with its mix of meteorological suspense, psychological insight and criminal pursuit, is arguably the best book yet in an outstanding, original oeuvre.” —Tom Nolan, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p> <p>\"Enchanting... one of his most ennobling missions.\" —Marilyn Stasio, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p> <p>\"With an uncompromising eye, Penny explores the depths of human emotion, both horrifying and sublime. Her love for her characters and for the mystical village of Three Pines is apparent on every page.\" —<i>Publishers Weekly, </i>starred review</p>";
