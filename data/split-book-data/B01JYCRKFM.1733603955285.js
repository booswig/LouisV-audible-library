Anderson's <i>Navigators of Dune</i> is the climactic finale of the Great Schools of Dune trilogy, set 10,000 years before Frank Herbert's classic <i>Dune</i>. </p> <p>The story line tells the origins of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and its breeding program, the human-computer Mentats, and the Navigators (the Spacing Guild), as well as a crucial battle for the future of the human race, in which reason faces off against fanaticism. These events have far-reaching consequences that will set the stage for <i>Dune</i>, millennia later. </p>";
