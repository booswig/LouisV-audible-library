window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i>,<i> USA Today</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly </i>Best Seller<br> “Full of valuable insights to guide you.” (Will Smith)<br> “Thoughtful and life-affirming...a must-read.” (Tony Robbins)<br> “This book will put you back in charge of your own life.” (Tom Brady)</p> <p><b>A new perspective on the overused and misunderstood concept of \"karma\" that offers the key to happiness and enlightenment, from the world-renowned spiritual master Sadhguru.</b></p> <p>What is karma? Most people understand karma as a balance sheet of good and bad deeds, virtues and sins. The mechanism that decrees that we cannot evade the consequences of our own actions. In reality, karma has nothing to do with reward and punishment. Karma simply means action: your action, your responsibility. It isn’t some external system of crime and punishment, but an internal cycle generated by you. Accumulation of karma is determined only by your intention and the way you respond to what is happening to you. Over time, it’s possible to become ensnared by your own unconscious patterns of behavior.</p> <p>In <i>Karma</i>, Sadhguru seeks to put you back in the driver’s seat, turning you from a terror-struck passenger to a confident driver navigating the course of your own destiny. By living consciously and fully inhabiting each moment, you can free yourself from the cycle. <i>Karma</i> is an exploration and a manual, restoring our understanding of karma to its original potential for freedom and empowerment instead of a source of entanglement. Through Sadhguru’s teachings, you will learn how to live intelligently and joyfully in a challenging world.</p>";
