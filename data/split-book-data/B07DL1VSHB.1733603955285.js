window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When they met at an airport, it was love at first sight. But in time, everything collapsed. As an unnamed but unforgettable woman muses on her life—from meet cute to marriage and parenthood—her recollections inexorably build to a devastating truth. In this shattering performance, Carey Mulligan, star of the critically lauded drama <i>An Education</i>, captivates audiences with playwright Dennis Kelly’s harrowing ruminations on family, ambition, gender, and violence. An acclaimed Off-Broadway play, the gut-wrenching world of <i>Girls &amp; Boys</i> now thrives as an Audible Theater production.</p> <p>After the play, this program includes an interview with Tony-winning playwright Dennis Kelly, who shares the inspiration behind his work.</p> <p><b>Note: </b><b><i>Girls &amp; Boys</i></b><b> is intended for a mature audience and contains graphic descriptions of violence. </b></p>";
