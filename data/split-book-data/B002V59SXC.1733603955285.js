window.bookSummaryJSON = "Julia Child became a household name when she entered the lives of millions of Americans through our hearts and kitchens. Yet few know the richly varied private life that lies behind this icon whose statuesque height and warmly enthused warble have become synonymous with the art of cooking. In this biography, Fitch takes us through her life from her exuberant youth as a high-spirited California girl to her years at Smith College, where Julia was at the center of every prank and party, to her volunteer work with the OSS and to her meeting Paul Child, the man who introduced her to the glories of art, fine French cuisine, and love. A biography of a woman modern before her time, this is the story of a truly American life.";
