window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ever since its first publication in 1992,<i> The End of History and the Last Ma</i>n has provoked controversy and debate. Francis Fukuyama's prescient analysis of religious fundamentalism, politics, scientific progress, ethical codes, and war is as essential for a world fighting fundamentalist terrorists as it was for the end of the Cold War. Now updated with a new afterword, <i>The End of History and the Last Man </i>is a modern classic.</p>";
