window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Unlike many personal finance books, <i>How to Manage Your Money When You Don't Have Any</i> was specifically written for Americans who struggle to make it on a monthly basis. It provides a respectful, no-nonsense look at the difficult realities of our modern economy along with an easy-to-follow path toward better financial stability that will give hope to even the most financially strapped households. </p> <p>Created by a financial expert who hasn't struck it rich, this guide offers a firsthand story of financial survival in the face of rough times. Rather than emphasizing wealth creation, <i>How to Manage Your Money When You Don't Have Any</i> teaches listeners to do the best they can with their incomes no matter their size. Content rich, personal, and jargon free, the book is opinionated, at times humorous, and full of current everyday references. </p>";
