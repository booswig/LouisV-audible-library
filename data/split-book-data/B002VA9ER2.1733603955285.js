window.bookSummaryJSON = "One of the most famous and influential books of its (or any) time, <i>The Origin of Species</i> is, surprisingly, little read. True enough, most people know what it says, or think they do, at any rate. The first comprehensive statement of the theory of natural selection, it does, indeed, provide the basic argument and demonstration of what we think of as Darwinism. <p>Not quite offering the misleading tautological Spencerian claim of \"survival of the fittest\", or the claim that man descends from monkeys (a typical perversion of the understanding of natural selection), the book did turn much of the world and how man thinks about it upside down. It is, well more than a century after its first publication, still a powerful and fascinating read. </p>";
