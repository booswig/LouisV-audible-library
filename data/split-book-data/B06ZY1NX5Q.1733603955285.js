window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first official Minecraft novel! In the tradition of iconic adventures like <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>and<i> Treasure Island,</i> the number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>World War Z </i>tells the story of a hero - stranded in the world of Minecraft - who must unravel the secrets of a mysterious island in order to survive. </b></p> <p>Washed up on a beach, the lone castaway looks around the shore. <i>Where am I? </i>Who<i> am I? And why is everything made of blocks? </i>But there isn't much time to soak up the sun. It's getting dark, and there's a strange new world to explore! </p> <p>The top priority is finding food. The next is not <i>becoming</i> food. Because there are others out there on the island...like the horde of zombies that appear after night falls. Crafting a way out of this mess is a challenge like no other. Who could build a home while running from exploding creepers, armed skeletons, and an unstoppable tide of hot lava? Especially with no help except for a few makeshift tools and sage advice from an unlikely friend: a cow. </p> <p>In this world, the rules don't always make sense, but courage and creativity go a long way. There are forests to explore, hidden underground tunnels to loot, and undead mobs to defeat. Only then will the secrets of the island be revealed. </p>";
