window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tibetan Buddhism describes three gates that everyone must pass through on the road to spiritual liberation. With the <i>Three Commitments</i>, Pema Chodron brings her unique blend of insight and gentle instruction to guide practitioners through each of these thresholds as they seek the source of true happiness. </p> <p>As Pema explains, suffering arises when we resist the laws of impermenance - the fact that everything we know, including ourselves, will one day die. Here she provides teachings and practices for fully embracing life's ephemeral nature using these three traditional monastic vows or \"commitments\". </p>";
