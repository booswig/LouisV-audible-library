window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Everfair</i> is a wonderful neo-Victorian alternate history novel that explores the question of what might have come of Belgium's disastrous colonization of the Congo if the native populations had learned about steam technology a bit earlier. </p> <p>Fabian Socialists from Great Britian join forces with African American missionaries to purchase land from the Belgian Congo's \"owner\", King Leopold II. This land, named Everfair, is set aside as a safe haven, an imaginary utopia for native populations of the Congo, as well as escaped slaves returning from America and other places where African natives were being mistreated. </p> <p>Nisi Shawl's speculative masterpiece manages to turn one of the worst human rights disasters on record into a marvelous and exciting exploration of the possibilities inherent in a turn of history. <i>Everfair</i> is told from a multiplicity of voices: Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and African Americans in complex relationships with one another, in a compelling range of voices that have historically been silenced. <i>Everfair</i> is not only a beautiful book, but an educational and inspiring one that will give the listener new insight into an often ignored period of history. </p>";
