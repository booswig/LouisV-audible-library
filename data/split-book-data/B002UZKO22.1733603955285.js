window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>New York Times</i> best seller Walter Mosley's sizzling new novel pits Easy Rawlins against his greatest challenge ever, a terrifying murder during the Summer of Love. It is the Summer of Love as <i>Cinnamon Kiss</i> opens, and Easy Rawlins is contemplating robbing an armored car. It's farther outside the law than Easy has ever traveled, but his daughter, Feather, needs a medical treatment that costs far more than Easy can earn or borrow in time. And his friend Mouse tells him it's a cinch. Then another friend, Saul Lynx, offers a job that might solve Easy's problem without jail time. He has to track the disappearance of an eccentric prominent attorney. His assistant of sorts, the beautiful \"Cinnamon\" Cargill, is gone as well. Easy can tell there is much more than he is being told; Robert Lee, his new employer, is as suspect as the man who disappeared. But his need overcomes all concerns, and he plunges into unfamiliar territory, from the newfound hippie enclaves to a vicious plot that stretches back to the battlefields of Europe.";
