As the Bhagavad Gita begins, the great warrior Arjuna is despondent to see his friends and relatives arrayed in battle before his chariot, intending to fight against his side in this war. In the midst of this dilemna, Arjuna refuses to fight and takes refuge in his friend Krishna, who then reveals his cosmic, universal form and teaches Arjuna the great wisdom of life, death, and enlightenment. </p> <p>Chapter one sets the stage with names of all the warriors and instruments of war that were gathered before Arjuna on the battlefield, and the subsequent chapters elucidate the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> teachings and wisdom.</p>";
