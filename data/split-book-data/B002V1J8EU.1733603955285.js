window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance</b> <p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Freakonomics</i> was a worldwide sensation, selling more than four million copies in 35 languages and changing the way we look at the world. Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with <i>Superfreakonomics</i>, and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first. </p> <p><i>SuperFreakonomics</i> challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as: How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa? What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common? Can eating kangaroo save the planet? </p> <p>Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is: good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.</p> <p><i>Freakonomics</i> has been imitated many times over - but only now, with <i>SuperFreakonomics</i>, has it met its match.</p>";
