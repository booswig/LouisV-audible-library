window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When we approach meditation as a wide-open embrace of life, we can let our bodies be our best meditation teachers. Created for yoga practitioners and everyone else, <i>Meditation for Yoga Lovers</i> invites you to join Lorin Roche to leap into a meditation practice unique to you (because it will naturally unfold from the rich tapestry of your own experience in the moment). </p> <p>With a poetic delivery and the wisdom of 40 years of teaching and practicing, Lorin describes the central skills of yoga meditation, including non-judgment, finding focus, tuning in to your inner world, the spirit of adventure, and more. Then he opens up the meditator's toolkit to share a series of guided exercises. </p> <p>\"Connectedness is the sacred function of meditation,\" explains Lorin Roche, \"because it is a time that we give ourselves to weave together and coordinate all of the elements of our being.\" <i>Meditation for Yoga Lovers</i> welcomes you to the beautiful art of inner connection with your own essence and life itself.</p>";
