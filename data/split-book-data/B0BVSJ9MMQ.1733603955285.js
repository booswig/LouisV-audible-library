window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first book in the Aghora trilogy containing the teachings of Dr. Svoboda’s mentor, the Aghori Vimalananda. Written almost entirely in Vimalananda’s own words, it presents events from his life, tenets of his philosophy, and highlights from his spiritual practices. Designed partly to shock and partly to comfort, but wholly as an offering to his Beloved, Aghora is a picture of a man who was a riddle wrapped up in an enigma.</p>";
