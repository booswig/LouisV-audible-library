window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We have a lifetime's association with our bodies, but for many of us they remain uncharted territory. </p> <p>In <i>Adventures in Human Being</i>, Gavin Francis leads the listener on a journey through health and illness, offering insights on everything from the ribbed surface of the brain to the secret workings of the heart and the womb; from the pulse of life at the wrist to the unique engineering of the foot. </p> <p>Drawing on his own experiences as a doctor and GP, he blends firsthand case studies with reflections on the way the body has been imagined and portrayed over the millennia. If the body is a foreign country, then to practise medicine is to explore new territory: Francis leads the listener on an adventure through what it means to be human. </p> <p></p>Both a user's guide to the body and a celebration of its elegance, this audiobook will transform the way you think about being alive, whether in sickness or in health. <p></p> <p>Gavin Francis is an award-winning writer and doctor and a contributor to <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i> and <i>London Review of Books</i>. </p>";
