Everyone wants to be the next big pie-contest winner, and it’s making them pie-crazy.

And the pleasure of doing something for the right reason.</p> <p>With <i>Pie</i>, acclaimed author Sarah Weeks has baked up a sweet and satisfying delight, as inviting as a warm pie on a cold day. You’ll enjoy every last bite.</p>";
