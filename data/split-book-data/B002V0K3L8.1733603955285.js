Now this gifted teacher's most useful audio sessions are available in one convenient resource with <i>The Eckhart Tolle Audio Collection</i>. This edition includes three audio best sellers with Eckhart Tolle: <p></p> <li> <i>The Realization of Being</i> - How meditation opens the entry point to stillness, our greatest spiritual teacher, allowing us to merge with this moment in time.<p></p></li> <li> <i>Living the Liberated Life and Dealing with the Pain-Body</i> - Points a way out of the conditioned mind that keeps us trapped and unhappy,to a deeper level of consciousness beyond thought.<p></p></li> <li> <i>Even the Sun Will Die</i> - Historic interview recorded on September 11, 2001, shows that even in the face of disaster, a miracle happens when we say \"yes\" to living in this moment and no other.</li>";
