window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With her trademark wit and easy charm, Barbara O’Connor spins a fantastic fable of friends, enemies, and superbly slimy bullfrogs. An amazing secret has tumbled off a freight train into Carter, Georgia, and Owen Jester is the only person who knows about it. If he can simply manage to evade his grandfather’s snappish housekeeper and keep his nosy neighbor, Viola, at bay, he just might be in for the summer of a lifetime.</p>";
