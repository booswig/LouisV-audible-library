window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sensuous and the sublime, the ordinary and the divine - on the Tantric path, all qualities merge as one in the ecstasy and wonder of awakening. </p> <p><i>Doorways to the Infinite</i> invites us to directly experience the core practices and insights of Tantra from its original source: Kashmir Shaivism's Vijnana Bhairava. This dialogue between the deity Shiva and his consort Devi unfolds the secrets for moment-to-moment awakening into inner freedom and open-eyed ecstasy. Now, Sally Kempton unpacks the hidden truths of this text, revealing it as a treasury of powerful pathways to direct revelation. </p> <p>With her gift for sharing subtle esoteric wisdom in an immediate and down-to-earth way, Kempton guides us into dozens of meditations and methods to engage our senses, imagination, breath, energy flow, attention, and postures as vehicles for radical and profound spiritual illumination. <i>Doorways to the Infinite</i> explores:</p> <ul> <li>The breath within the breath, the heart within the heart</li> <li>Listening, seeing, and feeling with full presence</li> <li>Awakening to your inner body as space and light</li> <li>Opening to the flow of your Kundalini energy</li> <li>Engaging intense emotions for Self-realization</li> <li>The spirituality of everyday activities</li> <li>Intimate relationships and lovemaking</li> <li>Physical movement, dance, and more</li> </ul> <p>A graceful gesture can lead to a heart-stopping realization of your body as divine. A long, slow exhalation of the breath can reveal your connection to the Source of everything. A sound - any sound - can take you to the reality beyond sound. Realizations can unfold in a thousand ways. With <i>Doorways to the Infinite,</i> discover your true self - not by transcending the world, but through the extraordinary hidden within ordinary life.</p>";
