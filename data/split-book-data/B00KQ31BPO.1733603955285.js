window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Annie Kagan is not a medium or a psychic, she did not die and come back to life; in fact, when she was awakened by her deceased brother, she thought perhaps she had gone a little crazy. </p> <p>In <i>The Afterlife of Billy Fingers: How My Bad-Boy Brother Proved to Me There's Life After Death</i>, Kagan shares the extraordinary story of her after death communications (ADC) with her brother Billy, who began speaking to her just weeks after his unexpected death. </p> <p>One of the most detailed and profound ADC's ever recorded, Kagan's audiobook takes the listener beyond the near-death experience. Billy's vivid, real-time account of his ongoing journey through the mysteries of death will change the way you think about life, death, and your place in the Universe. </p> <p>In his foreword, Dr. Raymond Moody, author of <i>Life after Life</i>, explains the phenomena of walkers between the worlds, known to us since ancient times, and says that Dr. Kagan's thought-provoking account is an excellent example.</p>";
