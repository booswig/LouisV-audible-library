window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>J. J. Tully is a former search-and-rescue dog who is trying to enjoy his retirement after years of performing daring missions saving lives. So he's not terribly impressed when two chicks named Dirt and Sugar (who look like popcorn on legs) and their chicken mom show up demanding his help to track down their missing siblings. </p> <p>But driven by the promise of a cheeseburger, J.J. begins to track down clues. Is Vince the Funnel hiding something? Are there dark forces at work, or is J.J. not smelling the evidence that's right in front of him? </p> <p>Best-selling author Doreen Cronin uses her deadpan humor to pitch-perfect effect in her first novel for young listeners.</p>";
