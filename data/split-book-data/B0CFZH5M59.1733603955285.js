window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It was a crime that shocked the country. On March 21, 2011, two young saleswomen were found inside a lululemon athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the nation's wealthiest suburbs. Jayna Murray, thirty, was dead—stabbed, slashed, and struck more than 300 times. Brittany Norwood, twenty-eight, was alive—tied up on a bathroom floor, her clothing ripped, her face bloodied. This is the full true story of what happened.</p> <p>\"In the field of true crime you never know what you'll get—a badly written clip job or thoughtful reportage that goes beyond the crime scene to the impact of crime on people and society. This book lines up on the latter side.
