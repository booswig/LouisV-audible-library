window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three years ago, 32-year-old Markus \"Notch\" Persson of Stockholm was an unknown and bored computer programmer. Today, he is a multi-millionaire international icon. <i>Minecraft</i>, the \"virtual Lego\" game Markus crafted in his free time, has become one of the most talked about activities since <i>Tetris</i>. Talked about by tens of millions of people, in fact.It is the story of unlikely success, fast money, and the power of digital technology to rattle an empire. And it is about creation, exclusion, and the feeling of not fitting in. </p> <p>Here Markus opens up for the first time about his life. About his old Lego-filled desk at school. About the first computer his father brought home one day. But also about growing up in a family marked by drug abuse and conflict. </p> <p>But above all it is the story of the fine line between seeming misfit and creative madman, and the birth of a tech visionary. <i>Minecraft: The Unlikely Tale of Markus \"Notch\" Persson and the Game that Changed Everything</i> is a Cinderella story for the Internet age.</p>";
