window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this dazzling collection of short fiction, the National Book Award Finalist and </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The History of Love - </i></b><b>“one of America’s most important novelists and an international literary sensation” (</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>) - explores what it means to be in a couple, and to be a man and a woman in that perplexing relationship and beyond.</b></p> <p>In one of her strongest works of fiction yet, Nicole Krauss plunges fearlessly into the struggle to understand what it is to be a man and what it is to be a woman, and the arising tensions that have existed from the very beginning of time. </p> <p>Set in our contemporary moment, and moving across the globe from Switzerland, Japan, and New York City to Tel Aviv, Los Angeles, and South America, the stories in <i>To Be a Man</i> feature male characters as fathers, lovers, friends, children, seducers, and even a lost husband who may never have been a husband at all. </p> <p>The way these stories mirror one other and resonate is beautiful, with a balance so finely tuned that the book almost feels like a novel. Echoes ring through stages of life: Aging parents and newborn babies; young women’s coming of age and the newfound, somewhat bewildering sexual power that accompanies it; generational gaps and unexpected deliveries of strange new leases on life; mystery and wonder at a life lived or a future waiting to unfold. </p> <p><i>To Be a Man</i> illuminates with a fierce, unwavering light the forces driving human existence: Sex, power, violence, passion, self-discovery, growing older. Profound, poignant, and brilliant, Krauss’s stories are at once startling and deeply moving, but always revealing of all-too-human weakness and strength. </p>";
