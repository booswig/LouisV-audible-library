window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Therapeutic Yoga for Trauma Recovery bridges the path of healing between the psyche and the body by walking you through the sacred practice of yoga so you can release the burdens of trauma from your body and mind.</p> <p>Grounded within the principles of polyvagal theory, affective neuroscience, and trauma-informed care, this book will help you gain a better understanding of how our brains and bodies respond to stress and trauma and offer a self-led healing journey toward feeling more empowered, grounded, clearheaded, inspired, and at ease.</p> <p>With her innately compassionate and gentle guidance, Dr. Arielle Schwartz introduces you to the power of the yogic philosophy and offers a variety of accessible yoga poses and breathing practices that will allow you to: nourish your nervous system; reconnect with your body; ground yourself in the present moment; release unresolved patterns of fight, flight, freeze, or faint; widen your ability to tolerate emotional discomfort; develop a felt sense of resilience; anchor yourself in self-love; reclaim connection with and trust in your body; and create a personalized yoga practice for your own self-care.</p>";
