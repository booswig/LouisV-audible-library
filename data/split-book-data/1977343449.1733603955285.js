window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is not a cookbook. This is something more: a travelogue, a patient investigation of Italy's cuisine, a loving profile of the everyday heroes who bring Italy to the table. <i>Pasta, Pane, Vino</i> is the latest edition of the genre-bending Roads &amp; Kingdoms style pioneered under Anthony Bourdain's imprint in <i>Rice, Noodle, Fish </i>and<i> Grape, Olive, Pig</i>. </p> <p>Town by town, bite by bite, author Matt Goulding brings Italy to life through intimate portraits of its food culture and the people pushing it in new directions: Three globe-trotting brothers who became the mozzarella kings of Puglia; the pizza police of Naples and the innovative pies that stay one step ahead of the rules; the Barolo Boys who turned the hilly Piedmont into one of the world's great wine regions.</p> <p>From the pasta temples of Rome to the multicultural markets of Sicily to the family-run, fish-driven trattorias of Lake Como, <i>Pasta, Pane, Vino </i>captures the breathtaking diversity of Italian regional food culture.</p>";
