window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ganesha also known more commonly in the west as Ganesh, is one of the most beloved, if not the most beloved deities in Hinduism. He is best known for his ability to help people remove obstacles in their lives. Although this I my first book on Ganesh, I have taught people the Ganesh mantras and they have used it with great success. I have received several emails stating that the Ganesh mantra added that extra spark they needed in their lives. Not only did it take their mantra work to a new level, some also used it in conjunction with western magick and he came through for them. </p> <p>Ganesh has an elephant head and this fact makes him very easy to recognize. However, what he is most known for his willingness and ability to help people remove obstacles in their lives. In addition to that, he is also a patron of the arts and sciences and has been known to help people with these fields as well. He is so effective that his worship can be found outside of Hinduism as well. Jains and Buddhists are also known to have devotion towards him. </p> <p>Although I do not have a main practice to Ganesh, I have used his power several times and can attest to his efficacy as can so many people not only in my sphere but the millions around the world. </p>";
