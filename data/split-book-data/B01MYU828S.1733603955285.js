window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Dhammapada</i> means \"the path of dharma\", the path of harmony and righteousness that anyone can follow to reach the highest good. This classic Buddhist scripture is a collection of vivid, practical verses gathered from direct disciples who wanted to preserve what they had heard from the Buddha himself. Easwaran's translation of this classic Buddhist text is the best-selling translation in the US. In the comprehensive introduction, he brings the story of the young Prince Siddhartha and his heroic spiritual quest vividly to life. His overview of the Buddha's teachings is reliable, penetrating, and accessible. The Buddha rejected superstition on the one hand and philosophical speculation on the other. He taught the path to the end of suffering and showed how we can achieve lasting joy. In <i>The Dhammapada</i> he spells out our choices with a refreshing realism and frankness. </p> <p><i>This audiobook is a complete narration of Eknath Easwaran's introduction and translation,</i> <i>but omits the short chapter introductions by other writers.</i></p>";
