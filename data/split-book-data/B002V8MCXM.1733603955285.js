window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>An audiobook in English with a Tamil accent.</b> <p>This novel is about one of the most ungodlike but lovable divine characters in mythology anywhere. It takes off from where the rest of the legends about Krishna stop. Krishna is shown here more as the human <i>avatara</i> he assumes, rather than the God behind the avatar.</p> <p> The author Indira Parthasarathi describes Him as an anti-hero, an anarchist, and a rebel extraordinaire, who yet forms an intrinsic part of the Indian cultural psyche. The author's fearless prism reveals the blue god in all his multihued splendor, while at the same time revealing his frailties and uncertainties as well.</p> <p>Krishna is a metaphor. He enables us to fulfill our dark desires in our unconscious state and also represents the collective vision of the community. His character transcends the bounds of religious orthodoxy or hidebound convention, or even the moral values we know. He is relevant in every age, every millennium, and every epoch.</p> <p>Butter thief as a child, heart stealer as a boy, and charmer of women of all ages as he grows into adulthood, Krishna is like no other god we know. His wit, his charm, his infinite wisdom that lurks below his casual exterior, have inspired some of the most joyous verse and legends in the rich tapestry of Indian mythology and spiritual literature.</p> <p><i>Krishna Krishna</i> portrays Krishna as our contemporary, a person relevant for all ages. In this novel, he is for once the hero, in sharp contrast with all the great epics in which he is always in the background of great enterprises and stratagems. Here he is the central figure around whom things happen.</p> <p>Listen to the voice of Krishna and immerse yourself in his infinite grace. It is a voyage you will never forget. Welcome aboard!</p>";
