window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Perhaps no one is more qualified to offer a program on the practice of both yoga and chant than Richard Freeman, who lived in India for nearly a decade mastering Sanskrit chant and how it can complement and enrich the practice of yoga. Now he shares the fruits of his intensive study with <i>Yoga Chants</i>, an instructional program on the authentic meaning, precise pronunciation, and yogic application of traditional Sanskrit chant. </p> <p>Drawing from the Upanishads and other classical yoga texts, <i>Yoga Chants</i> helps listeners invoke the sacred, find deeper meaning and empowerment in their yoga practice, and reach the ultimate goal of all yoga - namely liberation. Through commentary on the literal translation and modern understanding of the chants, and featuring the opportunity to participate in call-and-response chants of several Sanskrit mantras, <i>Yoga Chants</i> presents: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Why chant completes yoga practice in a way no pose alone can </li> <li>The science of sacred sound - proven physiological effects of chant </li> <li>Ancient chants from India for overcoming delusion, cultivating peace and prosperity, awakening insight into the happiness of pure Being, and much more </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>With <i>Yoga Chants</i>, listeners are invited to join world-renowned expert Richard Freeman for a session they can revisit time and again, to bring voice into harmony with body in an ever-deepening experience of realization and freedom. </p>";
