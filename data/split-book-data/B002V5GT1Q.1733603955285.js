window.bookSummaryJSON = "Ayn Rand is the author of two phenomenally best-selling ideological novels, <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, which have sold over 12 million copies in the United States alone. Through them, she built a right-wing cult following in the late 1950s and became the guiding light of Libertarianism and of White House economic policy in the 1960s and '70s. Her defenses of radical individualism and of selfishness as a \"capitalist virtue\" have permanently altered the American cultural landscape.";
