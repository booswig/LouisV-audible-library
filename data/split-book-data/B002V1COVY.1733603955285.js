window.bookSummaryJSON = "Rarely in a lifetime does a new spiritual classic appear that has the power to change people's lives and transform future generations. This is such a book. <i>The Essence of the Bhagavad Gita: Explained by Paramhansa Yogananda</i> shares the profound insights of Yogananda, author of <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i>, as remembered by one of his few remaining direct disciples, Swami Kriyananda. <p> This revelation of India's best-loved scripture approaches it from an entirely fresh perspective, showing its deep allegorical meaning as well as its down-to-earth practicality. The themes presented are universal: how to achieve victory in life in union with the divine; how to prepare for life's \"final exam\", death, and what happens afterward; and how to triumph over all pain and suffering.</p>";
