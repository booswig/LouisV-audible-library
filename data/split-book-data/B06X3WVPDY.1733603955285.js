window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Art of Vinyasa</i> takes a unique look at Ashtanga yoga as meditation in motion that produces profound inner change. Two of the most well-respected teachers of the Ashtanga style of yoga, Richard Freeman and Mary Taylor, explore this rigorous practice not as a gymnastic feat but as a meditative form. They reveal that doing the practice - and particularly the <i>vinyasa</i>, or the breath-synchonized movements - in such a deep and focused way allows practitioners to experience a profound awakening of the body and mind. It also develops an adaptable, flexible practice that can last a lifetime. </p> <p>Freeman and Taylor give an in-depth explanation of form, alignment, and anatomy and how they work together in the practice. They also present a holistic approach to asana practice that includes an awareness of the subtle breath and seamlessly merges yoga philosophy with practical technique. </p> <p>Unlike other books on Ashtanga, <i>The Art of Vinyasa</i> does not follow the linear pattern of the sequences of postures that are the hallmark of Ashtanga yoga. Instead it interlinks the eight limbs - <i>yama</i> and <i>niyama</i> (ethical practices); <i>asana</i> (postures); <i>pranayama</i> (breathing); <i>pratyahara</i> (nongrasping of the senses); <i>dharana</i> (concentration); <i>dhyana</i> (meditation); and <i>samadhi</i> (harmony, insight) - and shows how to establish an internally rooted yoga practice. </p>";
