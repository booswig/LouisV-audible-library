window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An <i>AudioFile</i> Magazine Earphones Award Winner </b></p> <p>This program is read by the author. </p> <p>It's time to move \"doing nothing\" to the top of your to-do list. </p> <p>In 2015 Manoush Zomorodi, host of WNYC's popular podcast and radio show <i>Note to Self</i>, led tens of thousands of listeners through an experiment to help them unplug from their devices, get bored, jump-start their creativity, and change their lives. <i>Bored and Brilliant</i> builds on that experiment to show us how to rethink our gadget use to live better and smarter in this new digital ecosystem. In this fascinating new audiobook, Manoush explains the connection between boredom and original thinking, exploring how we can harness boredom's hidden benefits to become our most productive and creative selves, without totally abandoning our gadgets in the process. </p> <p>Grounding her arguments in the neuroscience and cognitive psychology of \"mind wandering\" - what our brains do when we're doing nothing at all - Manoush includes practical steps you can take to ease the nonstop busyness and enhance your ability to dream, wonder, and gain clarity in your work and life. The outcome is mind-blowing. </p>";
