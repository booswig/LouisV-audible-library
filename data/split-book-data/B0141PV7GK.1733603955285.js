It sounds simple, but it's not. If it were, Tinder would just be the stuff you use to start a fire. Becoming your best self requires honesty, self-awareness, hard work, and a little help.</p> <p>Through their website and podcasts, Max and Miller have already helped over one million guys take their first steps toward Miss Right. They have collected all of their findings in Mate, an evidence-driven, seriously funny playbook that will teach you to become a more sexually attractive and romantically successful man, the right way:</p> <ul> <li>No \"seduction techniques\"</li> <li>No moralizing</li> <li>No bullshit</li> </ul> <p>Just honest, straightforward talk about the most ethical, effective way to pursue the win-win relationships you want with the women who are best for you.</p> <p>Much of what they've discovered will surprise you, some of it will not, but all of it is important and often misunderstood. So listen up, and stop being stupid!</p>";
