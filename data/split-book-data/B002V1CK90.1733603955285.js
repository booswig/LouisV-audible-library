window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Easwaran invites you on a journey, an adventure to find the supreme goal of life. </p> <p>Entertaining, thought-provoking, and moving, these four essays offer an hour of inspiration for listeners of any faith, philosophy, or lifestyle. </p> <p>Eknath Easwaran is one of the 20th century's great spiritual teachers and an authentic guide to timeless wisdom. He leads us through anecdotes, stories of the saints, surprising analogies, and wise insights that encourage us to explore what spiritual living can mean today. </p> <p>In \"Taking the Plunge\", Easwaran draws on a documentary about young penguins to teach us that it takes time for us to find our true path but that we can take our destiny into our own hands. </p> <p>In \"Chasing Rainbows\", he explores the nature of desire and what leads to lasting joy. </p> <p>In \"The Secret of Happiness\", he shows how by mastering our mind, we can achieve our real stature, far beyond anything we can imagine. </p> <p>The final essay, \"Climbing the Blue Mountain\", is a moving account of the spiritual quest. Easwaran compares this with a long journey that he makes from the hot, dusty plains of Central India, up through jungle and plantations, to his home in the cool hills of the Blue Mountains, where his mother waits for him - reminding us that on the spiritual path, we, too, will one day find our true home. </p> <p>The audiobook is a reading of four of the chapters from the book. </p>";
