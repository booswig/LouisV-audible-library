window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What do you do when you spot a wild Trump in the election season? <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and comedian Michael Ian Black has some sage advice for children (and all the rest of us who are scratching our heads in disbelief) in this perfectly timely parody book intended for adults that would be hysterical if it wasn't so true. </p> <p>The beasty is called an American Trump. </p> <p>Its skin is bright orange, its figure is plump. </p> <p>Its fur so complex, you might get enveloped. </p> <p>Its hands, though, are, sadly, underdeveloped. </p> <p>The Trump is a curious creature, very often spotted in the wild, but confounding to our youngest citizens. A business mogul, reality TV host, and now...political candidate? Kids (and, let's be honest, many adults) might have difficulty discerning just what this thing that's been dominating news coverage this election cycle is. Could he actually be real? Are those...words coming out of his mouth? Why are his hands so tiny? And, perhaps most importantly, what on earth do you do when you encounter an American Trump? </p> <p>With his signature wit and a classic style, comedian Michael Ian Black introduces those unfamiliar with the <i>Americus Trumpus</i> to his distinguishing features and his mystifying campaign for world domination...sorry...president of the United States. </p>";
