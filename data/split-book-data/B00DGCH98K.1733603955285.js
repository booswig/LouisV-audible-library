window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Discover an essential handbook for strategies, concepts, and insights into the dynamics of transformational leadership in these 24 lectures, which take you on an in-depth examination of the leadership behaviors and capabilities essential to creating positive change in teams and organizations. Filled with case studies and lessons from leaders in business, politics, sports, and the military, as well as a range of specific skills and strategies you can put to use in your own career, this lecture series is an authoritative guide to successful leadership. </p> <p>You'll learn why, unlike management, which focuses on achieving consistent and reliable results, transformational leadership focuses on producing change - sometimes very substantial or even radical change. After an introductory lecture on the definitions of effective, transformational leadership, you dive right into the nuts and bolts of this important professional skill. In order to make the subject well organized and easily accessible, Professor Roberto has arranged Transformational Leadership into four key modules, each of which offers a focused look at a particular aspect of leadership: models of leadership (which surveys critical issues such as human behavior and long-term goals); the change process (which focuses on resistance to change as well as ways to institutionalize it); critical skills and capabilities (including motivation, persuasion, negotiation, and teamwork); and creativity, innovation and learning (which is devoted to everything from after-action reviews to systems thinking to mentoring). </p> <p>Taken together, Professor Roberto's lectures are a stirring call to responsible leadership and a learning experience that's as informative as it is inspiring.</p>";
