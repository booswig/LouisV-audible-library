window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>Notes from a Small Island</b> <br>After nearly two decades in Britain, Bill Bryson decides to move his wife and kids back to his homeland, the United States. But not before taking one last trip around Britain, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home. The result is a hilarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain. <p><b>Neither Here nor There</b><br>Thirty years after backpacking across Europe, Bryson decides to retrace the journey he undertook in the halcyon days of his youth, carrying with him a bag of maps, old clothes, and a stinging wit honed to razor sharpness by two decades of adult experience.</p> <p><b>I'm a Stranger Here Myself</b><br>Bryson reads \"somewhere\" that nearly three million Americans believe they have been abducted by aliens; clearly the Americans need him back. So after years of raising his family in Britain with his English wife, the brood moves to the States, allowing Bill to chronicle the quirkiest aspects of life in America as he reveals his own rules for life.</p>";
