window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Building on the foundation laid by Moshe Feldenkrais, Thomas Hanna's groundbreaking work completely redefines the body's potential for withstanding decline. His gentle program for the mind and body proves once and for all that so many problems we accept as inevitable over time - chronic stiffness, bad back, chronic pain, fatigue, and, at times, even high blood pressure - need never occur if we maintain conscious control of nerve and muscle, replacing <i>Sensory-Motor Amnesia </i>with <i>Sensory-Motor Awareness.</i> The good news of Somatic Exercise is that most people simply do not have to become captives of age or injury. Once learned, this lifelong program can help almost anyone maintain the pleasures of a supple, healthy body indefinitely, with only a five-minute routine once a day.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
