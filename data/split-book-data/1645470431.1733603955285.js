window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Develop a powerful practice of deep relaxation and transformative self-inquiry with this essential guide to Yoga Nidra, including audio meditations.</b></p> <p>Yoga Nidra is a practice devoted to allowing your body and mind to rest while your consciousness remains awake and aware, creating the opportunity for you to tap into a deeper understanding of yourself and your true nature. At its heart, Yoga Nidra is about waking up to the fullness of your life. In <i>Radiant Rest</i>, Tracee Stanley draws on over 20 years of experience as a Yoga Nidra teacher and practitioner to introduce the history of Yoga Nidra, mind and body relaxation, and the surprising power of rest in our daily lives.</p> <p>This accessible guide shares six essential practices arranged around the koshas, the five subtle layers of the body: the physical, energetic, mental, intuitive, and bliss bodies. It also offers shorter, accessible practices for people pressed for time. Each practice is explained through step-by-step instructions and ends with self-inquiry prompts. A set of guided audio meditations provide further instruction. Feel a greater sense of stability, peace, and clarity in all aspects of your life as you deepen your Yoga Nidra practice and discover its true power.</p>";
