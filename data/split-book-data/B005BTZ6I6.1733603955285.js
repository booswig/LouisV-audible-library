window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the number one <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Lincoln Highway </i>and <i>A Gentleman in Moscow</i>, a “sharply stylish” (<i>Boston Globe</i>) book about a young woman in post-Depression era New York who suddenly finds herself thrust into high society - now with over one million readers worldwide.</p> <p>On the last night of 1937, 25-year-old Katey Kontent is in a second-rate Greenwich Village jazz bar when Tinker Grey, a handsome banker, happens to sit down at the neighboring table. This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a year-long journey into the upper echelons of New York society - where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve.</p> <p>With its sparkling depiction of New York’s social strata, its intricate imagery and themes, and its immensely appealing characters, <i>Rules of Civility</i> won the hearts of readers and critics alike.</p>";
