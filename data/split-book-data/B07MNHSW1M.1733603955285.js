window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Blackness is an art, not a science. It is a paradox: intangible and visceral; a situation and a story. It is the thread that connects these essays, but its significance as an experience emerges randomly, unpredictably.... Race is the story of my life, and therefore black is the body of this book.” </p> <p>In these 12 deeply personal, connected essays, Bernard details the experience of growing up Black in the South with a family name inherited from a White man, surviving a random stabbing at a New Haven coffee shop, marrying a White man from the North and bringing him home to her family, adopting two children from Ethiopia, and living and teaching in a primarily White New England college town. Each of these essays sets out to discover a new way of talking about race and of telling the truth as the author has lived it.</p> <p>\"<i>Black Is the Body </i>is one of the most beautiful, elegant memoirs I've ever read. It's about race, it's about womanhood, it's about friendship, it's about a life of the mind, and also a life of the body. But more than anything, it's about love. I can't praise Emily Bernard enough for what she has created in these pages.\" (Elizabeth Gilbert)</p> <p>Winner of the Christopher Isherwood Prize for Autobiographical Prose</p> <p>Named a Best Book of the Year by NPR and <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p> <p>One of Maureen Corrigan's 10 Unputdownable Reads of the Year </p>";
