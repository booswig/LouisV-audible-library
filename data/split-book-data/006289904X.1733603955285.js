window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From a leading neurologist, neuroscientist, and practitioner of Ayurvedic medicine, comes a rigorous scientific investigation of the healing power of sound, showing listeners how they can use it to improve their mental and physical wellbeing. </b></p> <p>Why does a baby’s cry instantaneously flood a mother's body with a myriad of stress hormones? How can a song on the radio stir up powerful emotions, from joy to anger, regret to desire? Why does sound itself evoke such primal and deeply felt emotions? </p> <p>A vibration that travels through air, water, and solids, sound is produced by all matter, and is a fundamental part of every species' survival. But there is a hidden power within sound that has only just begun to be investigated. <i>Sound Medicine</i> takes listeners on a journey through the structure of the mouth, ears, and brain to understand how sound is translated from acoustic vibrations into meaningful neurological impulses. Renowned neurologist and Ayurvedic expert Dr. Kulreet Chaudhary explains how different types of sound impact the human body and brain uniquely, and explores the physiological effects of sound vibration, from altering mood to healing disease.</p> <p>Blending ancient wisdom with modern science, Dr. Chaudhary traces the history of sound therapy and the use of specific mantras from previously unknown texts - traced back to the Siddhas, a group of enlightened yogis who created a healing tradition that served as the precursor to Ayurvedic medicine - to explain the therapeutic application of sounds for a wide range of conditions. <i>Sound Medicine</i> offers practical, step-by-step lessons for using music and mantras, whether you're a beginner or searching for a more advanced practice, to improve your health in body, mind, and spirit.</p> <p><b>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. </b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
