window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Three bicycles. Seven ghosts. A crumbling apartment block on the hill. Fame. Tenderness. The statue of Peter Pan. Silk. Melancholy. The banana tree. A love story.\"</p> <p>Virginia Woolf wrote that in order to be a writer, a woman needs a room of one's own. Now, in <i>Real Estate</i>, acclaimed author Deborah Levy concludes her groundbreaking trilogy of living autobiographies with an exhilarating, boldly intimate meditation on home and the specters that haunt it.</p> <p>In this vibrant memoir, Levy employs her characteristic indelible writing, sharp wit, and acute insights to craft a searing examination of womanhood and ownership. Her inventory of possessions, real and imagined, pushes listeners to question our cultural understanding of belonging and belongings and to consider the value of a woman's intellectual and personal life.</p> <p>Blending personal history, gender politics, philosophy, and literary theory, <i>Real Estate </i>is a brilliant, engaging narrative.</p>";
