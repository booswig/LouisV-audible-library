window.bookSummaryJSON = "Do you have back, neck, or shoulder pain that keeps recurring or won't go away? Do you have to \"baby\" your back? Does back pain keep you from living a full life? If so, you may be suffering from TMS - (Tension Myositis Syndrome) - and you don't have to take it anymore! <p>Dr. John E. Sarno, author of the revolutionary book <i>Mind Over Back Pain</i>, is a medical pioneer whose program has helped patients overcome their back conditions- without drugs or dangerous surgery. Now, using his latest research into TMS, Dr. Sarno goes one step further. After identifying stress and other psychological factors in back pain, he demonstrates how many of his patients have then gone on to heal themselves without exercise or other physical therapy.</p> <p>Discover why self-motivated and successful people are prone to TMS, how anxiety and repressed anger trigger muscle spasms, how people \"train themselves\" to experience back pain, and how you may get relief from back pain within two to six weeks by recognizing TMS and its causes.</p>";
