window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> first appeared in 1946, it was acclaimed as a landmark work in its field. <i>The New York Times</i> hailed it as \"a rare account\". <i>Newsweek</i> pronounced it \"fascinating\". <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i> declared, \"Yogananda presents a convincing case for yoga, and those who 'came to scoff' may remain 'to pray.\" Today it is still one of the most widely read and respected books ever published on the wisdom of the East.</p> <p>This audio edition, featuring Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley's masterful narration, contains the complete text of Paramahansa Yogananda's life story, an absorbing account of a singular search for Truth. Yogananda describes his experiences with modern-day saints and illuminated masters of India, and presents a definitive introduction to the whole science and philosophy of Yoga.</p>";
