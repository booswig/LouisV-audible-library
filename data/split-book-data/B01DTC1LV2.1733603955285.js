window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A beautiful, powerful new novel from the best-selling, award-winning author of <i>Sister of My Heart</i> and <i>The Mistress of Spies</i> about three generations of mothers and daughters who must discover their greatest source of strength in one another - a masterful, brilliant tale of a family both united and torn apart by ambition and love. </p> <p>The daughter of a poor baker in rural Bengal, India, Sabitri yearns to get an education, but her family's situation means college is an impossible dream. Then an influential woman from Kolkata takes Sabitri under her wing, but her generosity soon proves dangerous after the girl makes a single unforgivable misstep. </p> <p>Years later, Sabitri's own daughter, Bela, haunted by her mother's choices, flees abroad with her political refugee lover - but the America she finds is vastly different from the country she'd imagined. As the marriage crumbles and Bela is forced to forge her own path, she unwittingly imprints her own child, Tara, with indelible lessons about freedom, heartbreak, and loyalty that will take a lifetime to unravel. </p> <p>In her latest novel, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni explores the complex relationships between mothers and daughters and the different kinds of love that bind us across generations. <i>Before We Visit the Goddess</i> captures the gorgeous complexity of these multigenerational and transcontinental bonds, sweeping across the 20th century from the countryside of Bengal, India, to the streets of Houston, Texas - an extraordinary journey told through a sparkling symphony of voices. </p>";
