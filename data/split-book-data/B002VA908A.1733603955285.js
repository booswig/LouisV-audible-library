window.bookSummaryJSON = "A novel of rare genius, <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i> recounts the life of Francis Majcinek, \"Frankie Machine,\" who returned from World War II with a Purple Heart and a morphine habit. He relies on morphine to numb the pain of a war injury and the guilt he feels for a drunken spree that put his wife Sophie in a wheelchair. Frankie, a card-dealer in an illicit poker game, has now come back to Chicago's West Side after detoxing in the federal prison for narcotics addicts, being exposed again to all the pressures, anxieties, and temptations that put him there in the first place.";
