window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Bhagavad Gita is a gem so precious in India's spiritual treasury that many regard it not as a volume of sacred verse, but as a living manifestation of the Divine. In the summer of 1974, inside a balmy Boulder, Colorado, warehouse that served as a main hall of a fledgling Naropa Institute, some say a minor miracle occured: The reawakening of the Gita's living presence, as it unfolded in a series of wisdom teachings led by Ram Dass. With <i>Love, Service, Devotion, and the Ultimate Surrender</i>, you are invited to experience these legendary gatherings. </p>";
