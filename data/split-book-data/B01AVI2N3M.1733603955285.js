window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Featuring a delightful cast of characters and timeless Buddhist wisdom, and with His Holiness' compassion pervading every chapter, <i>The Dalai Lama's Cat</i> is simply enchanting. Not so much fly-on-the-wall as cat-on-the-sill, this is the warmhearted tale of a small kitten rescued from the slums of New Delhi who finds herself in a beautiful sanctuary with sweeping views of the snowcapped Himalayas. </p> <p>In her exotic new home, the Dalai Lama's cat encounters Hollywood stars, Buddhist masters, Ivy League professors, famous philanthropists, and a host of other people who come visiting His Holiness. Each encounter offers a fresh insight into finding happiness and meaning in the midst of a life of busyness and challenge. </p> <p>Drawing us into her world with her adorable but all-too-flawed personality, the Dalai Lama's cat discovers how instead of trying to change the world, changing the way we experience the world is the key to true contentment. </p> <p>This audiobook also contains six delightful tracks taking you through guided stretches and sits, including: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>How to sit when you meditate </li> <li>Standing roll down and breath counting </li> <li>Paw raise and purring </li> <li>Threading the needle and body awareness </li> <li>Cat pose and visualisation technique </li> <li>Shoulder bridge and analytical meditation </li> <li>Paw stretch, tranquillity and affirmations </li> </ul> <p></p>";
