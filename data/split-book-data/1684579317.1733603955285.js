window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A hymn to walking, the mechanical magic at the core of our humanity.</p> <p>In this captivating book, neuroscientist Shane O'Mara invites us to marvel at the benefits walking confers on our bodies and brains, and to appreciate the advantages of this uniquely human skill. From walking's evolutionary origins, traced back millions of years to life forms on the ocean floor, to new findings from cutting-edge research, he reveals how the brain and nervous system give us the ability to balance, weave through a crowded city, and run our \"inner GPS\" system. Walking is good for our muscles and posture; it helps to protect and repair organs, and can slow or turn back the aging of our brains. With our minds in motion we think more creatively, our mood improves, and stress levels fall. Walking together to achieve a shared purpose is also a social glue that has contributed to our survival as a species.</p> <p>As our lives become increasingly sedentary, O'Mara makes the case that we must start walking again-whether it's up a mountain, down to the park, or simply to school and work. <i>In Praise of Walking</i> illuminates the joys, health benefits, and mechanics of walking, and reminds us to get out of our chairs and discover a happier, healthier, more creative self.</p>";
