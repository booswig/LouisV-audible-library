When Chief Inspector Gamache is called to investigate, he is dismayed to discover that Olivier's story is full of holes.

And what other secrets and layers of lies are buried in the seemingly idyllic village? </p> <p>Gamache follows a trail of clues and treasures - from first editions of <i>Charlotte's Web</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> to a spiderweb with a word mysteriously woven in it - into the woods and across the continent before returning to Three Pines to confront the truth and the final, brutal telling. </p>";
