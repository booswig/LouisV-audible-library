window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audio bonus! Includes exclusive conversations with the authors!</b></p> <p><b>From an acclaimed Harvard professor and one of </b><b><i>Time</i></b><b>’s most influential people, this paradigm-shifting audiobook shows how almost everything we think we know about aging is wrong, offers a front-row seat to the amazing global effort to slow, stop, and reverse aging, and calls listeners to consider a future where aging can be treated.</b></p> <p>For decades, experts have believed that we are at the mercy of our genes and that natural damage to our genes - the kind that inevitably happens as we get older - makes us become sick and grow old.</p> <p>But what if everything you think you know about aging is wrong? What if aging is a disease - and that disease is treatable?</p> <p>In <i>Lifespan</i>, one of the world’s foremost experts on aging and genetics reveals a groundbreaking new theory that will forever change the way we think about why we age and what we can do about it. Aging isn’t immutable; we can have far more control over it than we realize. This eye-opening and provocative work takes us to the front lines of research that is pushing the boundaries on our perceived scientific limitations, revealing incredible breakthroughs - many from Dr. David Sinclair’s own lab - that demonstrate how we can slow down, or even reverse<i>, </i>the genetic clock. The key is activating newly discovered vitality genes - the decedents of an ancient survival circuit that is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it. Dr. Sinclair shares the emerging technologies and simple lifestyle changes - such as intermittent fasting, cold exposure, and exercising with the right intensity - that have been shown to help lead to longer lives.</p> <p><i>Lifespan </i>provides a road map for taking charge of our own health destiny and a bold new vision for the future when humankind is able to live to be 100 years young.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
