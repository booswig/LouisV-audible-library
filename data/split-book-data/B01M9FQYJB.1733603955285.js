window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>While serving with the Peace Corps in Swaziland, Thomas Cowan encountered the work of Rudolf Steiner and Weston A. Price - two men whose ideas would fascinate and challenge him for decades to come. Both drawn to the art of healing and repelled by the way medicine was - and continues to be - practiced in the United States, Cowan returned from Swaziland, went to medical school, and established a practice. He remained intrigued by the work of Price and Steiner and, in particular, with Steiner's provocative claim that the heart is not a pump. Dr. Cowan believes that Steiner was correct that the heart is not a pump, and our understanding of heart disease is completely wrong. And this gross misunderstanding is the reason heart disease remains the most common cause of death worldwide. </p>";
