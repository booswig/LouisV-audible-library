window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the Hugo Award–winning and New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse, James S. A. Corey, comes the start of a monumental new space opera series. <br> <br> HOW HUMANITY CAME TO THE PLANET CALLED ANJIIN IS LOST IN THE FOG OF HISTORY, BUT THAT HISTORY IS ABOUT TO END.<br> <br> The Carryx—part empire, part hive—has waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy in its conflict with an ancient and deathless enemy.<br> <br> When they descend on the isolated world of Anjiin, the human population is abased, slaughtered, and put in chains. The best and brightest are abducted, taken to the Carryx world-palace to join prisoners from a thousand other species.<br> <br> Dafyd Alkhor, assistant to a prestigious scientist, is captured along with his team. <br> <br> Even he doesn’t suspect that his peculiar insight and skills will be the key to seeing past their captors’ terrifying agenda.<br> <br> Swept up in a conflict beyond his control and vaster than his imagination, Dafyd is poised to become humanity’s champion—and its betrayer.<br> <br> This is where his story begins.<br> <br> “No one builds a universe like James S. A. Corey. The Mercy of Gods is wilder and weirder than you can imagine, and when it ends, all you’ll want is … more.”—John Scalzi, New York Times bestselling author</p>";
