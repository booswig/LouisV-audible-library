window.bookSummaryJSON = "Why evolution is more than just a theory: it is a fact. <p>In all the current highly publicized debates about creationism and its descendant \"intelligent design\", there is an element of the controversy that is rarely mentioned: the evidence, the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. Even Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, while extolling the beauty of evolution and examining case studies, have not focused on the evidence itself. Yet the proof is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from many different fields of science. Scientists are observing species splitting into two and are finding more and more fossils capturing change in the past - dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs.</p> <p><i>Why Evolution Is True</i> weaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, and anatomy that demonstrate the \"indelible stamp\" of the processes first proposed by Darwin. In crisp, lucid prose accessible to a wide audience, <i>Why Evolution Is True</i> dispels common misunderstandings and fears about evolution and clearly confirms that this amazing process of change has been firmly established as a scientific truth.</p> <p></p> <p>NOTE: Some changes to the original text have been made with the author's approval.</p>";
