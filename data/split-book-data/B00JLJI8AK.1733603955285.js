window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Negotiation is a big part of life - from buying a car or a house, taking a new job, or working out a serious conflict. Yet it's easy to believe we're usually at a disadvantage - that others are born negotiators, while we are not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Negotiation is a skill that just about everyone can learn to do well. </p> <p>Presented by a master negotiator, these 24 lectures teach you how to approach all phases of a negotiation and deal with a wide range of problems. Professor Freeman shows you how to negotiate effectively in both competitive and collaborative situations. You learn the art of handling sharp tactics, haggling, psychological traps, and other challenges, while always being \"hard on the problem and soft on the person\" - which is the key to achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. </p> <p>The course is organized around a mnemonic device, developed by Professor Freeman, that can serve in any negotiation situation. Called \"I FORESAW IT,\" this indispensable framework guides you in assembling the strongest possible case, showing you how to evaluate such factors as creative options, independent criteria, and your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Professor Freeman enriches his presentation with scores of fascinating anecdotes and case histories that vividly demonstrate what works and what doesn't when you sit down at the negotiating table.</p>";
