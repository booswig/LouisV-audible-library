window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number-one <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller</p> <p>Now a Netflix Film</p> <p><b>A remarkable tale of the island of Guernsey during the German Occupation, and of a society as extraordinary as its name. </b></p> <p>“Treat yourself to this book, please - I can’t recommend it highly enough.” (Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>)</p> <p>“I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.” </p> <p>January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb.... </p> <p>As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends - and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society - born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island - boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. </p> <p>Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</p> <p>Praise for <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society</i></p> <p>“A jewel... Poignant and keenly observed, <i>Guernsey </i>is a small masterpiece about love, war, and the immeasurable sustenance to be found in good books and good friends.” (<i>People</i>)</p> <p>“A book-lover’s delight, an implicit and sometimes explicit paean to all things literary.” (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>)</p> <p>“A sparkling epistolary novel radiating wit, lightly worn erudition and written with great assurance and aplomb.” (<i>The Sunday Times</i> [London]) </p> <p>“Cooked perfectly à point: subtle and elegant in flavour, yet emotionally satisfying to the finish.” (<i>The Times</i> [London])</p>";
