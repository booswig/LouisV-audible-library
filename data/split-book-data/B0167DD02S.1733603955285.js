window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For more than 4,000 years, the people of India have looked to Ayurveda as a pathway to vibrant health and increased longevity. This ancient healing science is treasured as a gift from the Vedas (the world's oldest sacred texts). Ayurveda offers all people a practical way to achieve self-realization, a way that is based not on constantly changing data but on the eternal forces of the universe. </p> <p>In <i>Ayurveda</i>, you will learn how to apply this fascinating system for total wellness to your own life. Your personal instructor in this audio study course is Dr. Vasant Lad, founder of the Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
