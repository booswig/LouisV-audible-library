window.bookSummaryJSON = "The H.M.S. <i>Leopard</i> pulled into the bay of Pulo Batang looking more like a shabby merchant ship that a man-of-war. The crew had endured a calamitous voyage plagued by gaol-fever, pursued by the Dutch <i>Waakzaamheid</i>, and struck by an iceberg. Suffice it to say, Jack Aubrey was ready for home. <p>The return journey aboard <i>La Fleche</i> proves delightful for both Aubrey and his particular friend. Stephen Maturin, with high winds and beautiful skies. It is when <i>La Fleche</i> nears the coast of Brazil that tragedy strikes. Accidental fire ravages the ship, forcing the crew into lifeboats. Rescued eventually by the <i>Java</i>, Aubrey and Maturin meet with yet another deterrent to their journey home when the <i>Java</i> engages the U.S.S. <i>Constitution</i> in battle, and loses. Aubrey, now a POW in Boston, waits for word of a prisoner exchange, while Maturin renews his friendship with the raven-haired expatriate, Diana Villiers.</p>";
