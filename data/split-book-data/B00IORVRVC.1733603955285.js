window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Regardless of industry, most major companies are becoming technology companies. The successful management of information has become so critical to a company’s goals, that in many ways, now is the age of the CIO. </p> <p>Yet IT executives are besieged by a host of contradictions: Bad technology can bring a company to its knees, but corporate boards rarely employ CIOs; CIOs must keep costs down at the very same time that they drive innovation. CIOs are focused on the future, while they are tethered by technology decisions made in the past. </p> <p>These contradictions form what Martha Heller calls The CIO Paradox, a set of conflicting forces that are deeply embedded in governance, staffing, executive expectations, and even corporate culture. Heller, who has spent more than 12 years working with the CIO community, offers guidance to CIOs on how to attack, reverse, or neutralize the paradoxical elements of the CIO role. Through interviews with a wide array of successful CIOs, <i>The CIO Paradox</i> helps listeners level the playing field for IT success and get one step closer to bringing maximum value to their companies. </p> <p>Gildan Media and Bibliomotion are proud to bring you another Bibliomotion Audiobook. Featuring exceptional content for today’s listener, these notable audiobooks contain the essential tools that can be applied to every facet of your life.</p>";
