window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's one of the oldest books in the world and India's biggest blockbuster best seller! But isn't it meant only for religious old people? But isn't it very long? And, erm, super difficult to read? And isn't the stuff it talks about way too complex for regular folks to understand? </p><p>Prepare to be surprised. Roopa Pai's spirited, one-of-a-kind retelling of the epic conversation between Pandava prince Arjuna and his mentor and friend Krishna busts these and other such myths about the Bhagavad Gita. Lucid, thought-provoking and brimming with fun trivia, this audiobook will stay with you long after you have heard the last words. Why haven't you listened to it yet? </p>";
